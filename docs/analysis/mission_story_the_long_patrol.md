### 39 Minutes Into Mission - Our Story Begins

**Bridge of USS Horizons, Sol System, Earth Orbit**

The USS Horizons floated peacefully in Earth's orbit, her Alliance green hull gleaming in the sunlight. The bridge was quiet—too quiet. Only one station was manned: Flight Control, where a lone cadet sat at the helm. The captain's chair was empty. Tactical, Operations, Science, Engineering—all unmanned.

Alert Level 1 blinked lazily on the displays—"Condition Docked"—though the ship was already underway. The mission briefing hung on the main screen: **"The Long Patrol"**—a routine patrol mission to check on comm stations throughout Alliance space. Three objectives remained:
- Hail all comm stations (0 of 3 complete)
- Scan all comm stations (0 of 3 complete)
- Ensure all stations survive (3 of 3—still alive)

The ship's course was plotted: Vareidan III → Betelgeuse → Mars → Earth. They hadn't even started.

### T+0 Minutes - Departure

**18:34 UTC**

"Alright, let's get moving," the flight officer muttered, finally engaging the engines. Alert status shifted to Level 2—Condition Green. The massive capitol ship, over 1000 meters long, began to accelerate away from Earth at a leisurely 0.3c maximum speed.

The ship's telemetry showed all systems nominal:
- Hull: 100% (1400 units)
- Shields: 100%
- Power: 2000/4000 units available
- Ordnance: 2 Silkworm missiles, 40 Mosquitos, 100 Wasps

Nine decks reported ready, temperatures steady at 22.4°C, crew efficiency at 100%. The three damage control teams—Alpha, Bravo, and Charlie—sat idle in their ready rooms, playing cards probably.

Container A-113 drifted past the viewscreen. Just another piece of space junk.

### T+2 Minutes - Setting Course

The flight officer finally noticed the navigation computer. "Oh right, we're supposed to go to Vareidan III first..."

But then they looked at Mars, glowing red in the distance. It was closer. Much closer.

"Eh, let's hit Mars first. What's the worst that could happen?"

The ship's nose swung toward the red planet. The autopilot engaged. In the cargo bay, Shuttle Aleana sat quietly in her docking clamps, unaware she'd never launch again.

### T+4 Minutes - Arrival at Mars

**Mars Orbital Space**

The Horizons dropped out of cruise as Mars filled the viewscreen. The planet's rusty surface sprawled beneath them. Almost immediately, proximity alarms chimed—contacts detected.

A COMM STATION appeared on sensors, proudly broadcasting its Alliance IFF signal. Then Research Lab R-1, marked as neutral. Various orbital platforms designated MARS-1 through MARS-5 pinged the ship's sensors.

"There's our comm station," the flight officer said, looking at the objectives list. "Someone should probably hail it."

No one did. The Operations station remained empty.

The ship's computer helpfully added a new objective: **"Return to Space Dock"**—as if it knew something the crew didn't.

---

### T+5 Minutes - Alert Status Change

**CONDITION YELLOW → RED ALERT**

The klaxons screamed to life. The bridge bathed in red emergency lighting. The flight officer's coffee mug rattled on the console.

"What the—"

On the tactical display, new contacts blazed into existence. The computer's voice, maddeningly calm, announced: "Warning. Hostile vessels detected. Daichi faction."

Four ships materialized from behind Mars:
- **CERN** - A battlecruiser with impossibly reinforced armor (400x normal hull strength)
- **KHAN** - Another capital ship
- **ICARUS** - Matching the first two in size
- **DART-BRD** - Smaller, but still massively armored (25x normal)

The Daichi. The mercenary faction from Betelgeuse that had vowed never to join the Alliance. And they'd brought a fleet.

---

### T+6 Minutes - Scramble

"TACTICAL STATION! SOMEONE GET TO TACTICAL!"

Finally, another crew member stumbled onto the bridge, diving into the tactical console. The weapons systems came online:
- Forward A: PULSE Cannon - Ready
- Forward Port: PULSE Cannon - Ready
- Missile tubes armed

The science station automatically began cycling through targets, gathering data on the enemy vessels. Each scan returned the same terrifying data: shields at 100%, hulls showing strength readings that shouldn't be possible.

The lone comm station, the mission objective they were supposed to protect, floated helplessly between the two forces.

---

### T+7 Minutes - First Blood

"Incoming fire!"

The Horizons shuddered as the first salvos struck. Shields flared brilliant blue, absorbing the initial impacts. The tactical officer, still figuring out the controls, managed to get a target lock.

"Firing Silkworm!"

The heavy missile, their best weapon with 600 damage potential, streaked away from the Horizons toward the CERN. It impacted seconds later in a brilliant flash.

The CERN's shields barely flickered.

"Their shields are still at 100%! How is that possible?"

Another volley incoming. Shields down to 75%.

"Fire everything!"

A Mosquito missile joined the Silkworm in space. The tactical display showed two projectiles active, racing toward their targets. The PULSE cannons opened up, sending streams of energy into the void.

---

### T+8 Minutes - The Tide Turns

The bridge shook violently. Sparks flew from an overhead conduit.

"Shields at 50%!"

The Daichi ships had spread out, surrounding the Horizons in a deadly crossfire. The DART-BRD, despite being smallest, maneuvered aggressively, its reinforced hull shrugging off the Horizons' desperate counterfire.

"Where's our backup? Where's the fleet?"

"We ARE the fleet! This was supposed to be a milk run!"

The science station frantically cycled through targets: 11933, 11934, 11935, 11936, 11937—analyzing, searching for weaknesses. There were none.

In the chaos, no one noticed the mission objective update: one comm station had been hailed somehow—probably an automated distress signal. 1 of 3 complete. Small victories.

---

### T+9 Minutes - Shields Down

"SHIELDS FAILING!"

The protective energy barrier collapsed with a thunderous crack that shouldn't have been audible in space but somehow was. The hull started taking direct hits.

"Hull at 75%... 50%... 25%!"

The flight officer tried evasive maneuvers, but the Horizons was a capitol ship—she turned like a pregnant whale. The Daichi vessels coordinated their fire with military precision.

Someone at the science station managed to complete a full scan of one comm station during the battle. 1 of 3 scans complete. They were still trying to complete the mission even as the ship died around them.

The "Return to Space Dock" objective mockingly showed as complete—technically true, in the cosmic sense. They'd never leave Mars now.

---

### T+10 Minutes - Final Moments

**Hull Breach - All Decks**

"Hull integrity at 10%... 5%..."

The tactical officer fired their last weapons, PULSE cannons blazing defiance into the dark. The Daichi ships closed in for the kill, their impossible armor untouched, their shields still reading 100%.

The flight officer looked at the mission timer: 44 minutes, 11 seconds.

"Longest patrol ever," they said, just before the final salvo hit.

**"Hull integrity: ZERO"**

The USS Horizons broke apart above Mars, her debris joining the orbital platforms she'd come to inspect. The mission computer, still functioning in a detached section of hull, dutifully recorded:

**MISSION: THE LONG PATROL**
**STATUS: FAILED**
**REASON: All Players Dead**
**OBJECTIVES COMPLETE: 2 of 4 (50%)**
**WAYPOINTS VISITED: 1 of 4 (Mars)**

The Daichi vessels held position for a moment, then turned and vanished back into the darkness behind Mars. The comm station—the one they were supposed to protect—continued broadcasting its lonely signal.

In the silence that followed, Mars Orbital Control logged the incident:
*"USS Horizons destroyed at coordinates -49488.9, 84485.78, 1297.53. Daichi faction responsibility confirmed. Notification sent to Alliance Command."*

### Epilogue - Mission Debrief

**Alliance Headquarters, Earth**

The Admiral stared at the telemetry readout. "A single flight officer... tried to take on four Daichi capital ships... alone?"

"There was a tactical officer too, sir. They joined during the battle."

"And no one manned Operations to hail the comm stations? Or Engineering to manage power? Or Science until the shooting started?"

"No, sir."

The Admiral rubbed his temples. "Note in the log: Future patrol missions require MINIMUM crew requirements be met before departure. And someone figure out how the Daichi got ships with 400 times normal hull strength."

He looked at the final entry: all three comm stations had survived, technically completing one objective.

"At least the stations made it. Small miracles, I suppose."

*Thus ended "The Long Patrol" - not with glory, but with the harsh reality that even routine missions can turn deadly when you're undermanned, overconfident, and facing an enemy that cheats with impossible armor values.*

**Mission Duration: 44 minutes, 11 seconds**
**Crew Lost: 2**
**Lessons Learned: Many**
**Comm Stations Saved: 3 of 3**

*"Sometimes, the longest patrol is the one you don't come back from."*
