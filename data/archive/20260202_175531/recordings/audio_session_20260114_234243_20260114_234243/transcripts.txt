============================================================

[00:00] speaker_1 (0.70): All right.
[00:03] speaker_2 (0.88): This is some walk in the park level shit, but it's the first time out together, things are going to get weird, don't worry too much about it.  Speak from diaphragm to each other, we're going to be okay.  The deal with this mission, we're going out to fuck around with some defense drones.  The first thing we're going to do is undocking, on which ops we're going to have to contact the station, request permission to undock.  I believe we can then undock from, if I forget if it's engineering or elsewhere, there's going to be an icon.  Once we get the permission to undock, undock.  Try not to hit anything as we go.  So, a flight that might come down to you.  We're going to go to navigate to Calavera.  Science is going to have a big-ass galaxy in Calavera,  so it's on there, probably close to us.  You might need to zoom in to see it, but you set the course there.  Tap the system, tap set course.  It's going to lead into flight control.  Flight control will then say, hey, ready to go to warp.  We do it.  We warp there.  We are then going to scan the planets.  It's time that they scan it and move on.  There's drones, we interact with them,  and then we go to Faraday to do the next bit.
[01:08] speaker_2 (0.79): Cleared so far, we're going to be able to see any stuff and we'll be able to react from there.
[01:39] speaker_2 (0.51): That's what we need to help you with.  We have some skills, there are some skills that we need to help you with.  Now we need terrorists.  Okay, you want to attack the perimeter?
[01:50] speaker_2 (0.53): Attack set course.  Target control should now have course laid in, para vera, as it should.
[01:56] speaker_2 (0.67): All docked. All docked. Okay, undocked us, back us out of the corner of the rampage until we get a few hundred meters clear.  Obstinate at the holding camera again.
[02:21] speaker_2 (0.56): All right, all faculty and boarders, go warp, all faculty and boarders.
[02:27] speaker_2 (0.69): All right, get us a few marks of red bull, get us away from that structure, we're gonna buzz it close. This is not the Roger Yellowing, we're not Carmen Rodriguez Ramirez.
[02:37] speaker_2 (0.78): Want to find out? Sign up on somebody else's bridge.  All right.  Okay, we've got a course laid in on Aribara.  Affirmative?  Shut up, sir, go ahead.  Engage?  That means yes.  All right.  Locking course at Aribara, engage.  Engineer, once we drop out of warp, take down warp engines to 20% of rated power.  We'll spring that up, put it to stand.  So we're going to have to go.  Once we're out.
[03:01] speaker_2 (0.56): All right, sorry, move up this way.  This is the top of the conference, we'll start in five minutes.
[03:10] speaker_2 (0.55): Did you ask them about transit?  Not transit.  Captain.  Not a second.
[03:18] speaker_2 (0.69): All right, we're going to de-warp eventually.  Okay, continue to drop that warp.  Science, what have we got for interesting planets?  Nice, we have another thing.  We have pair of air one, two, three, four, and five.  One, two, three, and five have higgins around them.  Okay.  One of them is inside itself.  All right.  We can ask Bill a lot of questions.  Lastly, pair of air three.  So, we have one, three, and the first.  Once again, we're going to go to the next one, so we don't plan it.  And Blake should have the course linked in for Calvary 3.  Gage, when ready.
[04:00] speaker_2 (0.56): Thank you very much.
[04:05] speaker_2 (0.68): No, yeah, what's the name of that?  I don't think it was a game.
[04:13] speaker_1 (0.63): Thank you.
[04:14] speaker_2 (0.59): We're bringing them in for that flight, but I think that's the way to go.  It looks like, I think, I think, what, that's great, I think, maybe routine.  Yeah, if it helps.  But yeah, considering this part, why don't you want to ask, right, why?
[04:25] speaker_2 (0.75): We're not going to work on them.  Oh, that's right, I asked for that. Yeah, balance out the power again, let's get it back to them, even across the board.  Even across the board?  Yeah.  Yeah, people want to get to the planet, to the system, you know, we've got a lot of work to do.
[04:40] speaker_2 (0.71): No! I don't want to, you know, I have to be fast, you know.  Okay, roger, this is the radar.  Alright, so, we should have started to get all the moves, let's see, we're gonna switch again, we need to dish it up and tatter, find it.
[04:53] speaker_2 (0.56): Uh, actually, I'll let him go.  Okay, all right, sorry.  You tapped it 10 seconds ago.  Radiance is going around the skin.  Right.  Right.  Right.  Right.  Right.  Right.  Right.  Right.  Right.  Right.  Right.  Right.  Right.
[05:20] speaker_2 (0.81): All right, so have we scanned, what have we got on that, uh, we need to scan? We have, a follow-up.
[05:29] speaker_2 (0.58): Uh, sentry turret, I think that's one of the big turrets in the balloon.  Yeah, we just got up here.  It's okay.  Ops portal turret, SNS field.
[05:40] speaker_2 (0.60): Very good, alright, so you should have something for sentry and to treat from A and B.
[06:00] speaker_2 (0.70): And science, we should see something for our target drone fleet Bravo. Yeah, that said, of course.
[06:21] speaker_2 (0.65): Nailed room. Peaceful day.  Okay, well that's their problem. Alright, so we've cleared this.  Oh wait, uh, yeah, conditioning at all, shields up.
[06:36] speaker_2 (0.77): I don't like the fact that they're making turns for us, let me get the, I'll see if you turn red. Yeah, maybe you're on, on screen, yes, maybe.  That's something I haven't done. Okay.
[06:47] speaker_2 (0.69): All right, I'm going to switch to red. So the set target for the ground sites, which should be like a bearing on it.  All right, all right, so I'm simply going to test for everyone. There we go.  All those out.  Oh, okay.  Well, you know, give to me back to action, please.  All right, right, three, two, three, mark one, seven.
[07:04] speaker_2 (0.68): Switch the camera if you need to.  Oh yeah, that was a good idea.  That was easier for you.  Self-migrant is in 20 kilometers, highway is a mechanic.  Alright, keep yourself locked on it. It's not going to take too long to kill him.
[07:25] speaker_2 (0.71): How close are you? We only need 20 kilometers range for the lasers.  Alright, drop the impulse to 50% if you need to start some further advice.
[07:35] speaker_2 (0.56): All right, I figured, I was like, aye sir, aye captain.
[07:42] speaker_2 (0.53): Okay, yeah, it looks right to 100%, we're going to do 12, come to the 48.  We can make sure we're proper.
[07:56] speaker_2 (0.56): 20 kilometers.  All fired.  Fire is not engaged.  Action.  Ships are, start firing.
