============================================================

[00:01] speaker_1 (0.52): Okay, all right.
[00:05] speaker_2 (0.87): This is awesome, walk in the park, love the shit, but it's the first time out together, things are going to get weird, don't worry too much about it, say it out loud, speak clearly, speak for diaphragms, and speak to me and each other, we're going to be okay.  The deal with this mission, we're going out to look around to see the fence roads.  The first thing we're going to do is undocking, on which ops you're going to have to contact the station, request permission to undock.  I believe we can then undock from, I forget if it's engineering or elsewhere, there's going to be a hike on.  Once we get the permission to undock, undock.  Try not to hit anything as we go.  So, a flight that might come down to you.  We're going to go to that each carat error.  Science is gonna have a big ass galaxy view  carat error system is on there, probably close to us.  You might need to zoom in to see it,  but you set the course there,  tap the system, tap set course,  it's gonna lay into flight control.  Flight control will then say,  hey, ready to go to warp, we do it.  We warp there, we are then gonna scan the planets.  We move on.  There's rooms.  We interact with them.  And then we go to Faraday to do the next bit.
[01:10] speaker_3 (0.72): Cleared so far, we're going, we'll, we'll scan new stuff and we'll better react from there.
[01:13] speaker_4 (0.51): Oh my god, what's your next call? It's over, Ryan.  Um, not very well.  Uh, Charlie and...  ...  ...  ...  ...
[01:32] speaker_6 (0.52): Okay, so I will run over, let's see what exactly that is, I will run around, yeah, that's how I will do it, where am I here, where, on the system, show where I am.
[01:42] speaker_2 (0.60): So that's what we need to help you with.  And then some sales, there's a certain set that we need to help you with.  So that, that always means errors.  Okay, you want to attack the perimeter?
[01:53] speaker_2 (0.54): We have attack set course.  Treason probes should now have course laid in.  Caravara, how's it look?
[01:58] speaker_2 (0.67): We're still docked, station. Go ahead for transpiration, undocked.  Okay, I can't do anything.  Okay, undock us, back us out of the quarter-inch until we get a few hundred meters clear.  Ops, make it a full cam room again.
