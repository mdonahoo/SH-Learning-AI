============================================================

[00:05] speaker_1 (0.56): Sergeant, head up, please.
[00:07] speaker_1 (0.63): So that's the first thing I want to say.
[00:17] speaker_1 (0.72): All right.
[00:19] speaker_1 (0.88): This is some walk in the park, club shit, but it's the first time out together, things are going to get weird, don't worry too much about it, say it out loud, speak clearly, speak from diaphragms, and speak to me and each other, we're going to be okay.  The deal with this mission, we're going out to look around to see defense drones. The first thing we're going to be doing is undocking, on which ops we're going to have to contact the station, request permission to undock.  I believe we can then undock from, I forget if it's in Canary or elsewhere, there's going to be a pipe on. Once we get permission to undock, undock, stride on to hit anything as we go.  So, a flight that might come down to you. We're going to then navigate to Parrot Arrow.
[00:59] speaker_1 (0.85): Uh, science is going to have a big-ass galaxy view, Karaveris is on there, probably close to us, you might need to zoom in to see it, but you set the course there, tap the system, tap set course, it's going to lay into flight control, flight control will then say, hey, ready to go to warp, you do it, we warp there, we are then going to scan the planets, tap the thing, scan it!

[01:19] speaker_1 (0.89): Go on. There's rooms, we interact with them, and then we go to Faraday to do the next thing.
[01:26] speaker_1 (0.72): We're clear so far, we're going to move, we see any stuff and we're going to react from there.
[01:30] speaker_1 (0.52): On the galaxy next to our solar ion. Um, not very healthy. Uh, try the, uh...
[01:41] speaker_1 (0.61): How can you come out of this?  I'm sorry.  How can you come out of this?  I'm sorry.  I'll be over here.
[01:47] speaker_1 (0.60): Okay, so I was that one, that's a great sample of what that is. Other than that, yeah, that thought was really deep.  Where am I here? Where am I in the system? Shall we go there?
[01:58] speaker_1 (0.61): That's about it. So that's what we need to help you with.  We have some signals. There are some signals that we need to help you with.  Systematic knowledge, new characters.  Okay, you want to attack the character?
[02:13] speaker_1 (0.71): There's no Dock on the station.  I don't have a transpiration L Dock.  I can't, I can't do anything.  Okay, undock us, back us out of the quarter-amputee, can we get a few hundred meters cleared?  Ops, can we get a full encambering again?

[02:39] speaker_1 (0.66): All right, fall back one quarter, all head one quarter.
[02:44] speaker_1 (0.82): All right, give us a few marks vertical, get us away from that structure, we're going to buzz in close. This is not the Roger Yalwin, you are not Carmen Rodriguez Ramirez.
[02:54] speaker_1 (0.78): You want to find out? Sign up on somebody else's bridge.  Alright.  Okay, we've got a course laid in on...
[03:03] speaker_1 (0.74): So, so what, they're kind of engaged. That means yes. All right. Locking course, set para para, engage.  Engineering, once we drop out of warp, take down warp engines to 20% of rated power, let's free that up, put it to TAMS.  20% of FPL. Once we're out.
[03:19] speaker_1 (0.64): Oh yeah, right, sorry. Move up, sir.  Bill Dyes is still here.  This is the fact of the matter.
[03:28] speaker_1 (0.66): Did you ask about warp transit?
[03:33] speaker_2 (0.50): Captain, not a psychic.

[03:37] speaker_1 (0.83): All right, we're going to de-warp eventually.  Okay, engineering, drop that warp.  Science, what have we got for interesting planets?
[03:49] speaker_1 (0.78): We have carrier 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
[03:53] speaker_1 (0.66): Uh, one, two, three, and five have paintings around them.  Okay.  Color has changed inside itself.  Alright, we can ask a lot of questions.  Lastly, paragraph three.
[04:05] speaker_1 (0.51): So, we have on top of our rocket, on top of the 10, the first, once again, ranking, next, first, and final.

[04:31] speaker_1 (0.65): That's like, waypointing, that's a good thing right now.  I would say, I could, I could go on screen, maybe on routine.  Yeah, well, if it helps.  But yeah, it's a good smart watch if you want to ask great questions.
[04:44] speaker_2 (0.63): Well, that kind of works, huh?
[04:46] speaker_1 (0.90): Oh, that's right, I asked for that one. Yeah, balance out the power again, let's get it back to even across the board.
[04:57] speaker_1 (0.80): No! I don't want to, you know, I have to be fast.
[05:03] speaker_1 (0.70): All right, so we should start, um, let's see, we're gonna see if she can reach up and tackle the planet.
[05:13] speaker_1 (0.55): Actually, I'll hang up.
[05:18] speaker_11 (0.60): Thank you.
[05:19] speaker_1 (0.59): Okay, all right, captain, captain, 10-7-8 radio, we can go in and out, in progress, right to where we're at.  We're at five hours, you know that, right?  Double, can I move?
[05:35] speaker_1 (0.64): Good night. We'll be right back.
[05:40] speaker_1 (0.69): All right, so, happily stand, what do we got on that, uh...
[05:43] speaker_2 (0.51): We need to stand.
