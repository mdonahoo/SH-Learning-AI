============================================================

[00:00] speaker_1 (0.66): All right.
[00:02] speaker_2 (0.89): This is some walk in the park level shit, but it's the first time out together, things are going to get weird, don't worry too much about it, say it out loud, speak clearly, speak from diagrams, and speak to me and each other, we're going to be okay.  The deal with this mission, we're going out to look around to see defense drones. The first thing we're going to be doing is undocking, on which ops we're going to have to contact the station, request permission to undock.  I believe we can then undock from, I forget if it's in Canary or elsewhere, there's going to be a hike on.  Once we get the permission to undock, undock.  Just try not to hit anything as we go.  So, a flight that might come around to you.  We're going to then navigate to Paravera.
[00:41] speaker_2 (0.88): Science is going to have a big-ass galaxy view, Caravera's tools on there, probably close to us, you might need to zoom in to see it, but you set the course there, tap the system, tap set course, it's going to lay into flight control, flight control will then say, hey, ready to go to warp, we do it. We warp there, we are then going to scan the planets, tap the thing, scan it.
[01:02] speaker_3 (0.86): Go on. There's drones, we interact with them, and then we go to Faraday to do the next bit.
[01:07] speaker_4 (0.76): Clear so far, we're going to move, we're scanning stuff, and we're going to react from there.
[01:12] speaker_5 (0.59): On the galaxy, that's about a total riot. Um, not very healthy. Uh, tardy, uh...
[01:23] speaker_6 (0.54): We're coming for that, we're coming for that, we're coming for that.
[01:29] speaker_5 (0.56): Okay, so I was at one of them, that's a great example of what that is, so that, yeah, that's obviously, where am I here, where my system, so where am I here?
[01:52] speaker_2 (0.64): Flight control should now have course laid in, air, air, how's that look?
[01:55] speaker_2 (0.69): It's all docks, actually.  I'm a member of the concentration, I'm docking.  I can't, I can't do anything.  Okay, undock us, back us out of quarter infancy until we get a few hundred meters cleared.  Ops, make it a full encambering again.
[02:13] speaker_2 (0.60): All right, see you, see you, okay, that's the director.
[02:21] speaker_1 (0.87): All right, all back, one quarter.
[02:23] speaker_1 (0.58): We're all headlin' for it.
[02:26] speaker_2 (0.82): All right, get us a few marks, get us away from that structure, we're going to buzz in close. This is not the Roger Yowlin, you are not Carmen Rodriguez Ramirez.
[02:37] speaker_2 (0.75): Want to find out? Sign up on somebody else's bridge.  Alright.  Okay, we've got a course laid in, uh, era vera.  Affirmative.
[02:51] speaker_2 (0.83): Engineering, once we drop out of warp, uh, take down warp engines to 20% of rated power, let's bring that up, put it to standards.  20% have to go.  Once we're out.
[03:02] speaker_2 (0.63): I got that, sorry, move up the ship.
[03:06] speaker_2 (0.56): This is the last time that I'm going to miss out on time.
[03:10] speaker_2 (0.59): Did you ask about warp transit?
[03:15] speaker_1 (0.66): Captain, not a psychic.
[03:18] speaker_2 (0.81): All right, we're going to de-warp eventually.  Okay, drop that warp. Science, what have we got for interesting planets?
[03:32] speaker_2 (0.74): We have Parabara 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.  1, 2, 3, and 5 have things around them.  Color has come by itself.  All right.  We've got a lot of questions on this one.  Last week, Parabara 3.
[03:54] speaker_2 (0.59): Flight should have course laid in for camera 3. Engage when ready.
[04:00] speaker_1 (0.60): We've lost him.
[04:05] speaker_2 (0.58): Oh, yeah, what's good with that?
[04:10] speaker_1 (0.53): Captain, what's the game?
[04:14] speaker_1 (0.56): I mean, the infrared plate was way more heavy than that.
[04:17] speaker_2 (0.63): I don't think I can, I can, I can, I can.  Yeah, well if it helps.  But yeah, so this is part one, if you want to add to the request.
[04:28] speaker_2 (0.88): Oh, that's right, I asked for that one. Yeah, balance out the tower again, let's get it back to even across the board.
[04:33] speaker_5 (0.65): Captain, do you want to get, do you want to get to the financing system, or do you want us out?
[04:39] speaker_1 (0.77): No! I don't want to be, you know, I have to be back.
[04:45] speaker_2 (0.65): Okay, all right, so, we should start, um, let's see, we're gonna see if she can reach up and attack our planet.
[04:54] speaker_5 (0.78): That's all, that's all, that's all.
[05:10] speaker_1 (0.64): Thank you very much.
[05:12] speaker_5 (0.75): You might be able to have the pod back up again.
[05:17] speaker_3 (0.52): Good night, we have a meeting when I sit back home.
[05:22] speaker_1 (0.74): All right, so have we scanned, what have we got on that, uh...
[05:25] speaker_1 (0.59): You need to stay.  We have a problem.
[05:30] speaker_3 (0.66): Uh, sentry turret, I think that's going to be...
[05:35] speaker_2 (0.67): Yeah, let's go up to... Okay, I'll just pull that turret, that's how it's feeling.
[05:40] speaker_2 (0.66): All right, so you should have something for sentry to execute from A to B.
[05:53] speaker_6 (0.54): I don't see anything in the rest of the public today.
[05:55] speaker_3 (0.51): Okay, we'll take your steps.
[06:03] speaker_2 (0.56): And science, we should see something for target drone 3 bravo, it's an X heavy force.
[06:14] speaker_2 (0.56): We held them, it's another central ferry.
[06:22] speaker_1 (0.54): Gale through, peace moving.
[06:27] speaker_2 (0.70): Well that's their problem, not ours, we can clear this up.
[06:33] speaker_4 (0.83): Yeah, condition yellow, shields up.
[06:36] speaker_3 (0.93): I don't like the fact they're making turns for us.
[06:38] speaker_1 (0.76): Let me get the...
[06:40] speaker_2 (0.63): Make the turn red. Yeah, main radar on, on screen please.
[06:46] speaker_2 (0.62): Alright, this is addition red, so the set target for the ground sites, which should be like a bearing on it, so simply move us whatever, there we go, pull those out, it's right here.  Oh, okay.  Uh, 3-25, back to the fleet.  Alright, flight connect 3-2-3, mark 1-7.
[07:06] speaker_2 (0.80): Switch to hammer if you need to.
[07:10] speaker_2 (0.52): Oh yeah, that's right captain, 3-1-6-5-20, captain, t-shirt for ya.
[07:16] speaker_2 (0.77): That would give us a 24-millimeter target, if we can.  Okay. All right, keep a good, solid lock on it. It's not going to take too long to kill.
[07:26] speaker_2 (0.80): How close are you? We only need 20 kilometers range for the lasers.
[07:30] speaker_2 (0.59): All right, dropping pulse to 50% if he starts to turn in place.
[07:36] speaker_1 (0.62): Okay, I figured, I was like, oh, I probably didn't want to talk to you.
[07:41] speaker_2 (0.64): Okay. Yeah, thank you very much.  We'll talk to him in a second.  We can make sure we talk to him.
[07:50] speaker_2 (0.50): Full impulse, fire, we're out of tip, must proceed to move on.
[07:57] speaker_5 (0.69): 20 kilometers, and I'm going to open fire.  Alright, this is our end game.
[08:08] speaker_1 (0.55): That's a hell of a way to end the war, I'll admit to it, buddy.
[08:12] speaker_2 (0.54): We're going to show you the 12 things first now.  Well, well, well, get a, get a cell or is it, get a strength piece of that or is it, get the grid, 60 feet.
[08:35] speaker_1 (0.57): Good job.  All right.  It was the worst we've ever run.
[08:46] speaker_2 (0.60): Wow, we get a little extra oxygen in here.  We're breathing on breeze.  Alright.  I can do two.
[09:00] speaker_2 (0.72): Okay, science has locked us on either of those drones, leave it to choice, and ops, once we get the drone locked, hail them.
[09:09] speaker_6 (0.54): All right.
[09:14] speaker_2 (0.76): That's going to be if it wants to die by shooting at us, think it's red.  Oh, I don't really think that's red.  Aye, we're about to do some bloodshed, can't you hear me?  Boost engine power to 125% to rated maximum, reactive power to 150% output, to 1-4-0, here you go.
[09:37] speaker_1 (0.64): Set, one, two, three,  Thank you.
[09:39] speaker_2 (0.75): Okay, if you relate that then, it pulls power up to 150 maximum flow.
[09:51] speaker_1 (0.59): HV turn on.
[10:00] speaker_2 (0.64): Did you read that? What's that?
[10:06] speaker_2 (0.58): Okay, I couldn't portray any missions, I can't do the barricades, can we get a rewind, I've got an hour and a half left here.
[10:16] speaker_1 (0.68): I'd play again.
[10:19] speaker_6 (0.57): We've got a problem.
[10:20] speaker_2 (0.54): All right, we're ready.  All right, bring my full chenilles to the next person on the ship.
[10:30] speaker_6 (0.60): We're ready to go, we're ready to go, we're ready to go.
[10:32] speaker_3 (0.64): Emergency status broken. There we go, we have received a distress call from Starbase Delta and the other stations in New York.
[10:42] speaker_2 (0.77): We're going to deal with the attack. That's you, we're going to find them and we're going to be the jury.
[10:48] speaker_1 (0.68): Captain, we're training the ship, the kids in the bearing system.
[10:52] speaker_2 (0.66): We have an hour of a re-courage that should be in the system somewhere.
[10:57] speaker_2 (0.61): We want to also be blocked by Faraday's knee of the phenomenon, which really won't make any difference.  Once you find a jury, squirt down to the behind the scenes, to the center, dispatch and provide cover, that we carry a clear of hostiles.  Force said Faraday, how about an actual battle?  Okay, we've got Faraday locked in. Stand down, bring us to the mission, yellow.

[11:26] speaker_2 (0.73): Okay, once we drop out, actually I have a little question.  Thank you.
[11:32] speaker_5 (0.53): Yeah. Pressure's down to... Oh yeah, no, it's...
[11:45] speaker_5 (0.57): Commands, please.  We're going to go, but don't worry about that approaching Faraday, I'm still in sight.  I know, but I'm waiting.  I'm going to have to hurry.  Okay, all right.  Science, what we got?  We got Faraday 7 and 8, it's city rooms.  Okay.  We're going to be checking those subways out.  All right, let's get the SIC work on Faraday 7.
[12:09] speaker_1 (0.61): All right, seven, four seven.
[12:12] speaker_1 (0.78): All right, engage.
[12:13] speaker_6 (0.60): We've got all this stuff right now, still thinks I'm a nerd, huh?
[12:17] speaker_1 (0.73): We're not really supposed to be like...
[12:21] speaker_1 (0.62): I think this is where we get ready.
[12:29] speaker_6 (0.55): Okay. We got a good chance.
[12:33] speaker_1 (0.52): Aye, aye, sir, sir, sir.
[12:40] speaker_2 (0.54): This is food, food. If you give the science guy that, he'll do the professional thing, you know.
[13:01] speaker_2 (0.60): Semi-scandals and fire action center, waiting by, mark, holding, normal, okay.  Now the probe is off the ship.  Yeah, but we've got a planet. Science is scanning the planet.
[13:19] speaker_2 (0.53): We give them a parting, something, I don't know, 3-8 minutes.
[13:23] speaker_2 (0.80): Okay, let's move. What's good on the planet, science?  Uh, no results.  No? What's that, top right? Looks like some results.
[13:33] speaker_2 (0.68): Get the exploders out of here.  That's the first thing.  Yeah, and that's the last thing.  Yeah, so am I, I'm freaking killing.  What about the planet?
[13:38] speaker_5 (0.76): And if you can scan the planet, you'll find that they are finished with this film there, by the way.
[13:44] speaker_2 (0.80): Appears to be a man-made structure in the northern hemisphere, one with a good, it appears to be ruins of alien origin, predates human space travel, that's for sure, and looks like some kind of outpost that studies the alien wave that is in fact insisting.
[14:00] speaker_3 (0.65): Seems like we've hit a triangular source, and we find another reference point.  Looks like the steering nose is too, because he has some probes, so we can get eye on things around here.
[14:10] speaker_2 (0.85): Alright, I think that's it. Who remembers Thayer Geometry? What do you need to triangulate something?
[14:19] speaker_2 (0.83): Point of that triangle, let's go find another one. What else is interesting in the system?
[14:25] speaker_1 (0.84): I think it was 7 and 8, right? You said, Vinnie?
[14:44] speaker_2 (0.58): Right, command of interest, you got a course laid in? No?
[15:03] speaker_2 (0.58): Make it so, back on with the game, it is time to make it so.
